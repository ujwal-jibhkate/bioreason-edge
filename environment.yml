  - defaults
dependencies:
  # Core Python (3.10 is stable for both WSL and Jetson/JetPack 6)
  - python=3.10
  - pip

  # Bioinformatics Libraries
  - biopython>=1.81       # For SeqIO and sequence handling
  - pandas                # For metadata handling later
  - numpy                 # Core math

  # Utilities
  - tqdm                  # Progress bars (essential for long batch processing)
  - ipykernel             # If you want to test in Jupyter notebooks
  - pathlib
  
  # ML/LLM Essentials (CPU/CUDA version for WSL)
  # Note: On actual Jetson, you will install torch differently via JetPack wheels
  - transformers
  - accelerate
  - sentence-transformers # For embedding models
  #- pytorch
  #- torchvision
  #- torchaudio
  #- pytorch-cuda=12.1     # Adjust based on your Windows/WSL NVIDIA driver version

  # Pip dependencies for edge-specific or newer tools
  #- pip:
  #  - hyena-dna           # If available via pip, or we install from source later
  #  - transformers        # For Hugging Face models
  #  - accelerate
  #  - bitsandbytes        # For quantization (essential for edge inference)
  #  - safetensors         # Efficient model loading
  #  - ont-bonito          # Basecaller (optional now, but good to have for ONT contexts)
